        <h2>Background</h2>
        <h6 class="ul">I am an international student from China and currently a senior student at Michigan State University. My major is media. I am a positive, sunny and optimistic person in my life. I like teamwork because I feel very happy to finish the work with my partner and I can save a lot of time. I also play some instruments and I play the guitar in my spare time. Music often helps me reduce stress and get to work faster. Of course sports are my favorites in my life, I will share some of my favorite sports in the list below and look forward to your participation.</h6>
