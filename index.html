				<p>Usually, having a good product does not mean that the product can sell well. But this topic can help us better promote our product. This is very important for all designers, and it can even make up for the shortcomings of some products.</p>
				<p>The first and most important one is confidence. Many times, "you can do it" and "you did it" are two things. For example, just like the product we designed, maybe the product itself has a very good prospect, but because of your shyness, your inadequate preparation leads to the unsatisfactory publicity of it, making this product unsalable. On the contrary, if a product can only meet some basic needs of the moment, but through your wonderful speech to build a beautiful blueprint for all investors, then this product will have a very good market. And, of course, both of these are extreme conditions and maybe you have a good product, and you have a great presentation and then it's going to grow by leaps and bounds.</p>
				<p>Now that you are confident enough to present your product to others, it is time to get noticed. Then the “Topic” matter becomes very important.</p>
				<p>First, you need to have an overall theme for everyone to know what feedback you expect and don't expect. Each slide needs to have a theme, not too much text, and use a good design template. This will make the customer pay more attention to what you are saying, which will let them give you the feedback you want.</p>
				<p>Now that you've got a complete system, let's talk about the content. If you're just boring reading, everyone will be drowsy. So storytelling will become very important. You can think of all the stories related to your product design. For example, I saw the purple and pink sky on the beach in San Diego, which made me feel more peaceful than ever before, so I used purple and pink in my design. And try to connect your context without being so abrupt. You also need to focus on bringing the client back from your story so that you have a summary at the end of each concept to help your client get into the right discussion mode more quickly.</p>
				<p>I think you are now ready to better present your product. Now let us switch roles. If we are customers, how can we provide feedback?</p>
				<p>What we need to give is balanced feedback. If your feedback is too positive, the designer will be immersed in utopian fantasy, which is very bad for product modification and improvement. But if your feedback is too negative, the designer will naturally be resistant, which is also not conducive to product improvement and iteration.</p>
				<p>Therefore, make that positive set of remarks be as vivid, elaborate and as detailed as the negative is going to be. You want the other person to feel that you approve of what they're doing but you're also suggesting that the product be better.</p>

				<p>There are many precautions for swimming. Stretching and warm-up activities before swimming should be done to fully stretch the muscles and joints, so as to prevent leg cramps caused by too low water temperature after swimming. If you do not do enough warm-up activities, you may not get used to the water temperature, which may lead to excessive excitement of muscles and lead to convulsions.Before swimming, eat food, but do not eat too full, swimming is a relatively large energy consumption of human body, swimming on an empty stomach, will cause hypoglycemia may cause syncope.In the later stage of eating to be fully active, the water temperature after entering the water is not too cool, it is best to be close to the temperature of the human body, in the process of swimming, the amount of exercise to be controlled in the range.Too much exercise isn't good for exercise either.</p>
